## About
reFullbright is a fabric mod that lets you enhance your Minecraft experience by making all the caves and dark areas of the game brighter. You can toggle the brightness with a keyboard shortcut `G (default)`. I also strive to keep this mod free of dependencies and extra API:s and libraries. reFullbright strives to keep itself simple and easy to use with staying away from advanced options pages and configuration by only having one shortcut for the whole mod.

## How to use it
Just install the mod using `Fabric for 1.20.1` and toggle the fullbright mode by pressing `G (default)`. The shortcut can be changed in the `Controls` option in Minecraft.
